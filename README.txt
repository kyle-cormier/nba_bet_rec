🏀 NBA Betting Recommender

This project implements an NBA betting recommender system designed to identify high-potential games for players to bet on.
It includes two core deliverables:

Recommender System (Python) — built in build_recommender.py

Streamlit Dashboard with integrated Generative AI — in app.py

1. Objective

Design and implement a recommendation engine that uses historical betting behavior and a vendor-provided playoff schedule to suggest daily Top-3 NBA games per player.
The solution simulates production at 9:00 AM EST each day and provides both personalized user recommendations and an internal OLG global view.

2. Data

Three datasets are used (provided as .xlsx and .csv):

df_train.xlsx — historical regular-season betting behavior

df_validation.xlsx — betting history during playoffs (for validation only)

playoff_schedule.csv — vendor-provided pre-season schedule

Key columns:

mask_id: player identifier

betdate: date of bet

event_description: game description (Home vs Away)

wager_amount: wager size in CAD

3. Recommender System (build_recommender.py)

Negative sampling to generate candidate datasets.

Feature engineering:

User statistics (mean, std, max wager, etc.)

Event statistics (total wager, mean wager, # bets)

Team affinity features (how often a user bets on specific teams).

Recency features (days since last bet, recent bets in 7/30 days).

Model: Logistic Regression with balanced classes.

Evaluation:

Validation AUC

Precision@3 and Recall@3

Outputs:

bet_recommender_model.pkl — trained model

validation_all_scores.csv — per-user/game scores

validation_top3_recommendations.csv — top-3 recs per user

model_classification_report.txt — metrics

4. Streamlit Dashboard (app.py)

The app has two main pages:

🔹 Page 1: Top-3 by User

Explore top-3 recommendations for each mask_id.

Option to view all users or a specific player.

🔹 Page 2: Workflow & Simulation

Daily Workflow (simulated 9AM EST run):

Displays vendor’s schedule for selected date.

Shows top-3 picks either per-user or global OLG view.

Option to generate personalized messaging via GPT-4o-mini.

Simulation (2-Week Backtest):

Compares predicted top-3 vs. actual betting behavior.

Reports Precision@3 / Recall@3.

Displays sample daily recommendations.

5. Deployment

The app is container-friendly (uses relative paths).

Run locally with:

streamlit run app.py


Replace st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"] with your own key for LLM messaging.

6. Alignment with Judging Criteria

✔ Recommender System Design & Performance — robust feature set, model, metrics.
✔ Generative AI Integration — GPT-powered personalized messaging.
✔ Streamlit Usability & Innovation — interactive dashboard with dual perspectives.
✔ Simulation & Validation — 2-week backtest with precision/recall reporting.
✔ Code Quality — modular scripts, documented steps, cached loaders.
✔ Strategic Relevance — daily workflow at 9AM EST, aligned with OLG operations.
✔ Creativity & Initiative — team affinity + recency features, dual-view dashboard.
✔ Communication — visual, intuitive UI for both analysts and business users.

7. Next Steps / Improvements

Deploy to secure cloud (e.g., Streamlit Cloud + custom domain).

Explore advanced models (XGBoost, neural recommenders).

Expand validation to multiple seasons.
